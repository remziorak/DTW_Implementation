2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
NSTD-1#1 Critical Warning
Unspecified I/O Standard  
99 out of 100 logical ports use I/O standard (IOSTANDARD) value 'DEFAULT', instead of a user assigned specific value. This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all I/O standards. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified I/O standard value defined. To allow bitstream creation with unspecified I/O standard values (not recommended), use this command: set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks NSTD-1].  NOTE: When using the Vivado Runs infrastructure (e.g. launch_runs Tcl command), add this command to a .tcl file and add that file as a pre-hook for write_bitstream step for the implementation run. Problem ports: dtw_out[31:0], en, finish_sign, rst, test_data[31:0], template_data[31:0].
Related violations: <none>

UCIO-1#1 Critical Warning
Unconstrained Logical Port  
100 out of 100 logical ports have no user assigned specific location constraint (LOC). This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all pin locations. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified site LOC constraint defined.  To allow bitstream creation with unspecified pin locations (not recommended), use this command: set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks UCIO-1].  NOTE: When using the Vivado Runs infrastructure (e.g. launch_runs Tcl command), add this command to a .tcl file and add that file as a pre-hook for write_bitstream step for the implementation run.  Problem ports: dtw_out[31:0], clk, en, finish_sign, rst, test_data[31:0], template_data[31:0].
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-1#1 Warning
PREG Output pipelining  
DSP euclidean_distance_inst/dsp_inst1/U0/i_synth/i_synth_option.i_synth_model/opt_7series.i_uniwrap/i_primitive output euclidean_distance_inst/dsp_inst1/U0/i_synth/i_synth_option.i_synth_model/opt_7series.i_uniwrap/i_primitive/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-1#2 Warning
PREG Output pipelining  
DSP euclidean_distance_inst/dsp_inst2/U0/i_synth/i_synth_option.i_synth_model/opt_7series.i_uniwrap/i_primitive output euclidean_distance_inst/dsp_inst2/U0/i_synth/i_synth_option.i_synth_model/opt_7series.i_uniwrap/i_primitive/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
Related violations: <none>

ZPS7-1#1 Warning
PS7 block required  
The PS7 cell must be used in this Zynq design in order to enable correct default configuration.
Related violations: <none>

AVAL-4#1 Advisory
enum_USE_DPORT_FALSE_enum_DREG_ADREG_0_connects_CED_CEAD_RSTD_GND  
euclidean_distance_inst/dsp_inst1/U0/i_synth/i_synth_option.i_synth_model/opt_7series.i_uniwrap/i_primitive: DSP48E1 is not using the D port (USE_DPORT = FALSE). For improved power characteristics, set DREG and ADREG to '1', tie CED, CEAD, and RSTD to logic '0'.
Related violations: <none>

AVAL-4#2 Advisory
enum_USE_DPORT_FALSE_enum_DREG_ADREG_0_connects_CED_CEAD_RSTD_GND  
euclidean_distance_inst/dsp_inst2/U0/i_synth/i_synth_option.i_synth_model/opt_7series.i_uniwrap/i_primitive: DSP48E1 is not using the D port (USE_DPORT = FALSE). For improved power characteristics, set DREG and ADREG to '1', tie CED, CEAD, and RSTD to logic '0'.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-31#1 Advisory
enum_PREG_0_connects_CEP_GND  
euclidean_distance_inst/dsp_inst1/U0/i_synth/i_synth_option.i_synth_model/opt_7series.i_uniwrap/i_primitive: When the DSP48E1 PREG attribute is set to 0, the CEP input pin should be tied to GND to save power.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-31#2 Advisory
enum_PREG_0_connects_CEP_GND  
euclidean_distance_inst/dsp_inst2/U0/i_synth/i_synth_option.i_synth_model/opt_7series.i_uniwrap/i_primitive: When the DSP48E1 PREG attribute is set to 0, the CEP input pin should be tied to GND to save power.
